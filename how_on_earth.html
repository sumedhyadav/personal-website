<p style="text-align: justify;">I started following comic books recently. Furthermore, scanty availability of comic books in Indian towns doesn't make life easier. Moreover, mostly I enjoy the complex and intertwined nature of today's comic books. Kudos to the writers, an event in yesterday's comic will eventually come to fruition in a five years later comic. To get most out of a comic book, relying on the memory map (and sometimes wits and theories) of a comic expert's verbal story telling has proven to be more fruitful. On top of it, listening to their exciting and enthusiast commentary will eventually turn anyone in a comic book fan :P. All that said just follow a video or two from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/fluidicbeats" target="_blank">ComicsExplained</a> channel or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/comicstorian" target="_blank">Comicstorian</a> channel. The following Logan story stands out in its story telling.</p>
