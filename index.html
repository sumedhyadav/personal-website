<ul>
<li>I am a mechanical major.</li>
<li>Nonetheless, I want to pursue graduate education in computing fields.</li>
<li>Coding is <i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i>. I discovered the love quite late, but since the enlightenment, I believe coding is the closest thing to human superpower.</li>
<li>I am a football virgin. Probably I will turn out to be a Madridista or Bayern MÃ¼nchen fan.
<li>I don't read comics but I am an enthusiast (
<a href="./how_on_earth.html">HOW ON EARTH?</a>
)! Marvel comics and Batman. Can't wait to see the big screen adaptation of Avengers: Infinity War.</li>
<li>I watch loads of movies, thriller, horror, crime and sci-fi. But I found a new love for TV series, basically comic and others from Netflix.</li>
<li>Well, if you look at the source code for this website you can easily infer that I am not good at web-designing. I am working on it, and intent to abstract as much as possible (sass...) to deploy a website template.</li>
<li>This website is not designed for mobile devices, further proving my web-designing clumsiness.</li>
<!-- <li>I am so so at English grammar either.</li> -->
</ul>
