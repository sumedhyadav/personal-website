		<h4>Movies and TV series</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Most of the times I am a lazy person, and what better option than watching a movie.</li>
			<li>New or old, WWII movies are just great. Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Inglourious Basterds, Dunkirk, Fury, Bridge of Spies... </li>
			<li>Binge watching a TV series is even better.</li>
			<li>Thriller and crime are my favorite genres, but I finish any comic adapted TV series before them!</li>
			<li>I don't know how or why but I do watch romantic comedies, currently I am watching Beauty and the Beast.</li>
			<li>Suggest me any great TV series, regardless of genre.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Football</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Recently, I have started enjoying football.</li>
			<li>...sometimes when I am not lazy, I play too, but that's mostly shambolic.</li>
			<li>I just wish that my chicken legs are transformed overnight... :(</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Music</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Life can be sometimes tough, but music makes the tough pass away.</li>
			<li>Linkin Park is always rejuvenating, so is Coldplay and so is Eminem.</li>
			<li>Classic, electronic pop (90s) is catchy. Fireflies, Daft Punk, Bitter Sweet Symphony...</li>
		</ul>
